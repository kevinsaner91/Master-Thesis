# Master-Thesis

The files in the folder R contain all the code, that was used in the different experiments.

In order to run the code one must install the following software:

* R (Version 4.1.0)
* Keras (Version 2.4.0)
* Tensorflow (Version 2.5.0)

Some files use absolute paths, that need to be updated when running the code.
