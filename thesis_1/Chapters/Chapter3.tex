\section{Introduction}
This section describes which research approach was chosen and why. Further, it elaborates, how the research approach is implemented and what work is done in the corresponding sections. 

\section{Research Design}
As the research methodology design science research was chosen. Design science research typically focuses on the creation and performance of artifacts with the explicit goal of improving the artifact's functional performance. It is often applied to artifact categories such as algorithms, human/computer interfaces and design techniques and therefore optimally suits the purpose of this research project.

Design science research knows five process steps. These are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Awareness of the Problem
	\item Suggestion
	\item Development
	\item Evaluation
	\item Conclusion
\end{itemize}

Following, it is outlined what will be done in the different process steps and how it is going to help answering the research question. 

\subsection{Awareness of the Problem - Literature Review}

\subsection{Suggestion - Data Selection}

\subsection{Suggestion - Design of Experiments}

\subsection{Development - Experiments}

\subsection{Evaluation - Results Analysis}

\subsection{Conclusion - Recommendations}
